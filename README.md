# Practical machine learning project

This repository contains the R markdown file fro PML project : Predicting exercise class from movement data. The Rmd file has eval=FALSE in a few chunks where training occurs, because the training is resource intensive and was carried out separately.
Here is the link to the HTML page http://rpubs.com/cmacus/416852

The exercise is part of [Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialisation at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
